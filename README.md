# Exploratory Analysis of Job Market Trends and Salary Prediction using PySpark
This project embarks on an in-depth exploration of job market data utilizing PySpark, a powerful tool known for its scalability and efficiency in handling vast datasets. The primary goal is to unveil hidden insights and discernible patterns within the dynamic job market landscape.

## Project Overview
The project begins with the meticulous acquisition and preprocessing of job market data sourced from diverse repositories, including CSV files and databases. Key steps encompass data cleaning procedures such as addressing missing values, standardizing data types, and eliminating duplicates to ensure dataset integrity and reliability.

- Data Acquisition: A sizable dataset has been collected from Kaggle, spanning over 1.6 million records with 23 features, covering a period of 25 months from September 2021 to September 2023, sourced globally.

- Data Engineering: Before delving into analysis, essential data engineering tasks are undertaken to ensure data integrity and usability.

  - Handling Missing Values: Various techniques are employed to address missing values, ensuring minimal impact on analysis outcomes.
  - Data Type Conversion: Ensuring correct data types for each feature is crucial for accurate analysis.
  - Range Data Splitting: Ranges, such as salary or experience ranges, are split into separate columns to facilitate analysis.
  - Encoding: One-hot encoding is applied where necessary to enable effective analysis.

- Descriptive Statistics: Leveraging PySpark's DataFrame operations, descriptive statistics are computed to understand the distribution of key variables such as job titles, salaries, and geographical locations, providing a solid foundation for further analysis.

- Exploring Job Market Trends: Trends in job postings are meticulously examined by aggregating data on job types, degree types, work types, and preferences. Visual representations such as bar plots reveal significant trends and fluctuations within the job market landscape.

- Temporal Analysis: PySpark's time-series functionalities are utilized to dissect trends over time. Job postings are aggregated into discrete intervals, enabling the identification and visualization of significant temporal trends using line charts and bar plots.

- Emerging Trends: PySpark facilitates the identification of latent patterns through rigorous frequency analysis. Emerging trends are identified and elucidated using PySpark MLlib and Spark NLP, providing valuable insights into evolving job market dynamics.

- Geospatial Analysis: Geographical patterns and regional disparities within the job market landscape are elucidated through advanced geospatial analysis. PySpark's capabilities are leveraged to spatially map job postings, identifying clusters and hotspots. Spatial join operations link job postings with geographical regions, enabling comprehensive visualization through cartographic representations.

- Skill Demand Analysis: Text processing functionalities are employed to analyze skills and qualifications extracted from job descriptions. Frequency analysis and text mining techniques identify sought-after skills and keywords, offering insights into prevailing skill trends.

- Industry and Sector Analysis: Segmenting job market data based on industry and sector categorizations provides insights into sector-specific dynamics. Growth rates and demand metrics are computed, facilitating visualization and analysis across distinct industry sectors.

- Salary Analysis: Salary distributions across job roles and industries are comprehensively analyzed using PySpark's statistical functions. Histograms and box plots visually depict prevailing compensation trends, informing stakeholders with actionable insights.

- Modeling and Salary Predictions: Machine learning models are utilized for salary prediction based on data features, providing valuable predictive insights.

- Documentation: Key findings and insights are comprehensively documented using Markdown cells within PySpark notebooks, offering stakeholders actionable recommendations to navigate the dynamic job market landscape effectively.

Through this exploration using PySpark, the project aims to equip stakeholders with actionable insights and a comprehensive understanding essential for navigating the complex dynamics of the modern job market landscape.
